This is a hack created for the HackMIT 2018 that won **Best use of the Kensho Knowledge Graph**. 

Nemo is a natural language processing framework for collecting data and statistics relevant to a video or audio input

It involved creating the data pipeline and the NLP algorithms required to parse the text from the video and classify the most relevant sentences into categories which were then sent to custom made endpoints to get relevant information.
