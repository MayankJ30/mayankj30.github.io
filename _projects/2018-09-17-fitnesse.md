This was a hack created for the PennApps 2018 that won **Top 10 Hack**, **Best Health Hack**, and **Best use of Machine Learning/AI**. 

Being fitness enthusiasts, we wanted to create something that could give real-time feedback to users on their exercise form using recent advances in machine learning and CV. 

For this hack, we employed a CNN trained on the COCO Dataset for Human Pose Detection and used
openCV with a custom math model to detect form errors.

We paired this with an Apache Server on Googleâ€™s Computing Engine with Flask to deploy the app.
