mOSs is a fully-functioning kernel, written as the final project of 15-410 (Operating System Design and Implementation), at Carnegie Mellon.

While not POSIX-compliant, this kernel was compliant with a smaller set of standards (Pebbles), developed over multiple iterations of this course. Code is available upon request.
